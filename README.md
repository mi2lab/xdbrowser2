XDBrowser 2.0
=============

XDBrowser is a prototype of a cross-device web browser designed to support our user studies around desirable cross-device interfaces presented in our [CHI 2016](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858036.2858048) and [CHI 2017](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025453.3025547) papers. This Git repository contains data from the two latest XDBrowser studies described in our [CHI 2017](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025453.3025547) paper:

- Study 1

    * [XDBrowser slides](study1-slides.pdf) used to prime participants in Study 1. 

    * [XDBrowser 2.0 video](study1-video.mp4) illustrating two of the referencts used to elicit cross-device interactions in Study 1.

    * [XDBrowser 2.0 interaction set](study1-interactions.xlsx) designed by participants to trigger cross-device interfaces as part of Study 1. 

- Study 2

    * [instructions and tasks](study2-tasks.pdf) used to guide participants through Study 2.

    * [testset and labels](study2-labels.xlsx) created by participants in Study 2.

    * [agreement scores](study2-agreement.xlsx) calculated for the participantsin Study 2. 

    * [analysis of differences and notes](study2-notes.pdf) created by students in Study 2.    

The original XDBrowser was created by [Michael Nebeling](http://www.michael-nebeling.de) as part of his research at ETH Zurich, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Michigan. Michael is now an Assistant Professor at the [University of Michigan School of Information](https://si.umich.edu) where he leads the [Information Interaction Lab](https://mi2lab.com). If you have any questions about this research or his other projects, please do not hesitate to get in touch with him at [nebeling@umich.edu](mailto:nebeling@umich.edu).
